# SLUG

This story was created with [Spectate](https://github.com/spec-journalism/spectate).

## Setup

Run `spectate clone SLUG`, which will clone the repository `spec-journalism/SLUG` into a new directory named `SLUG` and copy over Google Docs keys. Make sure you have first completed the [prerequisites and setup instructions](https://github.com/spec-journalism/spectate#prerequisites) for Spectate.

## Usage

Make sure you are inside the project directory.

To start the development server, run `npm run dev`.

To re-download the Google Doc, run `make download`.

## Deploying to the web

### GitHub Pages

Run `spectate gh-deploy`, which will ensure that a `dist/` to `gh-pages` working tree exists, and then push changes to `gh-pages`.

### Arc

1. Set the value of `slug` in the Makefile. In `package.json`, set `--public-url` to the S3 link:
```
https://spectator-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/SLUG
```

2. Uncomment the appropriate override stylesheet in `styles.scss`.

3. Run `make deploy-arc`.

4. Copy the contents of `dist/index.html` into Ellipsis.
